	<h3>SCENE 1</h3>
	<p>In my memory, although there was always a big black computer at home in my dad and sister's room, I never opened it or studied it. I just thought it was a giant "machine" that I couldn't use and get close to. Whenever I saw my father or sister sitting at the desk and tapping on a board, some words would appear on the screen in front of them. Although I was curious, I just thought it was a toy for adults.</p>
